# Smart HVAC Diverter

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Most standard HVAC duct systems distribute air uniformly, which often leads to inefficient airflow in multi-room setups. This adjustable diverter provides localized airflow control without needing to retrofit the entire duct, improving comfort and reducing energy waste.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Fusion 360 (CAD modeling)
- SimScale (CFD analysis)
- ASME Y14.5 (drawing standards)
- GitHub (version control)

## 📐 Design Overview
Created a three-part parametric diverter with adjustable flaps. The CAD model features interlocking geometry and screw holes for real-world assembly onto circular ducts.

## 🌀 Simulation Results
SimScale CFD analysis showed that adjusting the diverter angle from 0° to 45° reduced virtual backpressure by 15%, while maintaining consistent airflow velocity across both duct branches.

## 📊 Results
- ✅ 15% reduction in virtual backpressure
- ✅ Maintained airflow velocity distribution
- ✅ Parametric, modular design for quick adaptation
